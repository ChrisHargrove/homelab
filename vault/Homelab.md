This is the obsidian vault containing all the documentation for my home-lab. This is primarily to be a repo for all the required steps to get the home-lab up and running as well as to provide any relevant diagrams for the architecture and available services in the home-lab.

## Overview
This home-lab is going to be run eventually on a mix of x86 and ARM machines. The software choice for the home-lab will be kubernetes to allow for running containerised software.
