An open-source platform that automates the management of containerised applications. Also known as "K8s". The flavour of kubernetes that will be used in this home-lab will be [k3s](https://k3s.io/).
## What it does
- Deploys, scales and manages containerised applications.
- Automates operational tasks like provisioning, networking, and load balancing.
- Monitors applications and restarts failed containers.
- Abstracts infrastructure so developers can focus on applications.
## How it's used
- To run distributed applications and services at scale.
- To manage containerised applications at the edge, closer to where data is generated and consumed.
- To manage and scale AI and machine learning workloads.
## Benefits
- Reduces operational costs
- Reduces time-to-market
- Helps break up monolithic applications into more maintainable microservices.
- Allows developers to move seamlessly from development to production.
## High Availability
Kubernetes can also be configured to run in [[High Availability (HA)|HA]] which gives a stronger, more robust architecture for services that minimises downtime.
