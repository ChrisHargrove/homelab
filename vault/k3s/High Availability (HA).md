Is the ability of a system to operate without interruption for a set amount of time, even if some of the components fail.
## How it works
### Redundancy
Having a single or multiple backup components that will take over for the primary in the event of a failure of the primary.
### Load Balancing
Spreading the workload across multiple servers to prevent any one server from becoming overloaded.
### Failover
Having a strategy to automatically switch to a backup if a the primary one fails.
### Monitoring
Continuously monitoring the health of the servers/components and detecting failures as they occur.
## Benefits
- Allows for meeting agreed-upon performance levels for the service.
- Can handle different loads and failures with minimal to zero downtime
- Ensures continuous access to data and services, even if there are hardware failures, software glitches, or network outages.
